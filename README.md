![](server/assets/dmb.gif)

### Features implemented

- Server side that provides router for serving the proper data from database.
- Paginated table of provided csv file {page size selection included} / \*\*\* due to wrong .csv file format there was a challenging implementation & and you might see wrong data.(no time to improve the reading of csv)

\*\* the csv file's records decreased to 3k, for performance purposes and saved for use at /server/assets

### Project architecture

- Monorepo
- ExpressJS for http requests
- MongoDB & mongoose for data storing and manipulation
- ReactJS for front end SPA
- Redux state management
- Redux thunk for async functionalities
- React router for navigation / lazy loaded(there is 1 route but is settled lazy for future purposes)

### Potential improvements

- GraphQL
- Jest unit tests
- Cypress e2e tests
- Microservice for reading/writing .csv files regarding .csv patterns
